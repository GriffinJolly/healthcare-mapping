EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
======================================================================

This analysis examines healthcare accessibility across Chennai by mapping
1385 healthcare facilities and calculating distance metrics
for 10,000 analysis points across the city.

KEY FINDINGS:
- 14.2% of Chennai's area is more than 5km from healthcare
- Median distance to nearest facility: 1.48 km
- Only 58.0% of areas are within 2km of a facility
- Hospital access lags behind overall facility access

======================================================================
METHODOLOGY
======================================================================

Data Source: OpenStreetMap (OSM)
Study Area: Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India
Analysis Date: February 2026

Facilities Mapped:
  • Hospitals: 600
  • Clinics: 400
  • Pharmacies: 213
  • Total: 1385

Analysis Method:
  • Created 100x100 grid (10,000 analysis points) across Chennai
  • Calculated distance from each point to nearest facility using geospatial algorithms
  • Used KDTree data structure for efficient nearest-neighbor searches
  • Measured both straight-line (Euclidean) distances

======================================================================
DETAILED FINDINGS
======================================================================

1. DISTANCE METRICS

Average distance to nearest healthcare facility: 2.28 km
Median distance: 1.48 km
Maximum distance (worst case): 10.37 km

The median of 1.48 km suggests most residents have reasonable 
access, but the maximum of 10.37 km indicates some areas face 
significant barriers to healthcare access.

2. COVERAGE ANALYSIS

Area within 1km of healthcare: 40.8%
Area within 2km of healthcare: 58.0%
Area within 5km of healthcare: 85.8%
Area within 10km of healthcare: 99.9%

INTERPRETATION:
- 42.0% of Chennai requires >2km travel for healthcare
- At 2km (approximately 25-minute walk), this represents a significant barrier
- Nearly universal coverage (99.9%) within 10km, but distance still matters

3. HOSPITAL-SPECIFIC ACCESS

Average distance to nearest hospital: 2.47 km
Median distance to hospital: 1.73 km
Area within 5km of hospital: 84.9%

Hospital access is slightly worse than overall facility access, suggesting
that hospitals are more centrally concentrated while clinics and pharmacies
provide better peripheral coverage.

4. UNDERSERVED AREAS

14.2% of Chennai (1419 grid points) is more than 5km 
from the nearest healthcare facility.

Most underserved locations (furthest from healthcare):

======================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

Based on this analysis, we recommend:

1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
   • Investigate the 14.2% underserved areas for new facility placement
   • Focus on regions >5km from current facilities
   • Prioritize areas with high population density among underserved zones

2. STRATEGIC PLANNING:
   • Aim to increase 2km coverage from 58.0% to >75%
   • Target locations that would serve multiple underserved grid points
   • Consider mobile health clinics for extremely remote areas

3. DATA QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS:
   • Validate OSM data with government health department records
   • Add population density data to weight accessibility metrics
   • Include public transportation routes for more realistic travel times

4. FUTURE ANALYSIS:
   • Compare accessibility with actual health outcomes
   • Analyze temporal patterns (facility operating hours)
   • Assess capacity and quality, not just location

======================================================================
LIMITATIONS
======================================================================

- Data completeness depends on OpenStreetMap contributor activity
- Analysis uses straight-line distance, not actual travel routes
- Does not account for facility capacity, quality, or specialization
- Grid-based analysis may not perfectly represent population distribution
- Some facilities may be missing or misclassified in OSM

======================================================================
CONCLUSION
======================================================================

Chennai demonstrates reasonable healthcare coverage overall, with a median
distance of 1.48 km to the nearest facility. However, 14.2%
of the city's area remains underserved (>5km from healthcare), representing
a significant equity concern.

The concentration of hospitals in central areas while clinics provide better
peripheral coverage suggests opportunities for targeted intervention. Strategic
placement of just a few new facilities in identified underserved zones could
dramatically improve overall accessibility metrics.

This analysis provides a data-driven foundation for healthcare planning
decisions and can be replicated for other cities to identify and address
healthcare access gaps.
